                            oon the freeCodeCamp curriculum will be 100% project-driven learning. Instead of a series of
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p> coding challenges, you'll learn through building projects - step by step. Before we get into the
                        details, let me emphasize: we are not changing the certifications. All 6 certifications will
                        still have the same 5 required projects. We are only changing the optional coding challenges.
                        After years - years - of pondering these two problems and how to solve them, I slipped, hit my
                        head on the sink, and when I came to I had a revelation! A vision! A picture in my head! A
                        picture of this! This is what makes time travel possible: the flux capacitor!
                        It wasn't as dramatic as Doc's revelation in Back to the Future. It just occurred to me while I
                        was going for a run. The revelation: the entire curriculum should be a series </p>
                </div>

                <div class="para para2">
                    <p>of projects. Instead of individual coding challenges, we'll just have projects, each with their
                        own seamless series of tests. Each test gives you just enough information to figure out how to
                        get it to pass. (And you can view hints if that isn't enough.)

                    <p class="border">" The entire curriculum should be a series of projects "</p>

                    No more walls of explanatory text. No more walls of tests. Just one test at a time, as you build up
                    a working project. Over the course of passing thousands of tests, you build up projects and your own
                    understanding of coding fundamentals. There is no transition between lessons and projects, because
                    the lessons themselves are baked into projects. And there's plenty of</p>

                <div class="para para3">
                    <p> repetition to help you retain everything because - hey - building projects in real life has
                        plenty of repetition.
                        The main design challenge is taking what is currently paragraphs of explanation and instructions
                        and packing them into a single test description text. Each project will involve dozens of tests
                        like this. People will be coding the entire time, rather than switching back and forth from
                        "reading mode" to "coding mode".
                        Instead of a series of coding challenges, people will be in their code editor passing one test
                        after another, quickly building up a project. People will get into a real flow state, similar to
                        what they experience when they build the required projects at the end of each certification.
                        They'll get that sense of forward progress right from the beginning. And freeCodeCamp will be a
                        much smoother experience.</p>

                    <h1>A Brief History</h1>
                    <p>Of the Curriculum</p>
                    <h3>V1 - 2014</h3>
                    <p>We launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources, including Harvard's CS50 and
                        Stanford's Database Class.</p>
                    <h3>V2 - 2015</h3>
                    <p>We added interactive algorithm challenges.</p>
                    <h3>V3 - 2015</h3>
                    <p>We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we'd been relying on General Assembly's Dash course
                        for these).</p>
                    <h3>V4 - 2016</h3>
                    <p>We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front End, Back End, and Data
                        Visualization. They each had 10 required projects, but only the Front End section had its own
                        challenges. For the other certs, we were still using external resources like Node School.</p>
                    <h3>V5 - 2017</h3>
                    <p>We added the back end and data visualization challenges.</p>
                    <h3>V6 - 2018</h3>
                    <p>We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This was the biggest curriculum
                        improvement to date.</p>
